# Following are the instructions to deploy virtualenv for fetcher project in production
# I have struggled to install gdal using pip and hence i rely on getting site packages. May be in future gdal installation will get cleaner or i will find another way to find country codes hence removing the need of gdal.
apt-get install libgdal-dev (this is optional)
apt-get install python-gdal
virtualenv --system-site-packages fetcher
cd fetcher
source bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
